## Overview
Movies are a huge part of the entertainment industry, and analyzing their performance can reveal valuable insights. In this project, we take a closer look at a comprehensive movie dataset to explore key factors such as popularity, ratings, genres, and box office revenue. The insights are showcased through interactive dashboards to help spot trends and support smarter decisions in the movie business.
## Problem Statement
Our analysis aims to answer the following key questions:
-	Genre, Language, and Release Patterns: How are movies distributed by genre, language, and release year?
-	Top-Rated Movies: Which movies stand out in terms of high ratings and strong vote counts?
-	Popularity Over Time: How has movie popularity changed over the years?
-	Successful Movies: Which films generated the highest revenue?
-	Ratings by Language and Genre: Do movie ratings differ based on the original language or genre?
-	Average Runtime Trends: How does movie length vary over the years?
-	Revenue by Genre: Which genres tend to bring in the most revenue?
-	Language Frequency: How often do different original languages appear in the dataset?
## Process
- Imported the movie dataset into Excel and cleaned it by removing duplicates, filling missing values, and formatting columns like dates and genres.
- Created additional columns in Excel to make the data easier to analyze in Power BI.
- Loaded the cleaned and prepared Excel file into Power BI for visualization.
- Built different charts in Power BI—such as bar charts, line graphs, and Block charts—to explore trends in popularity, ratings, revenue, and more.
- Organized visuals into a clean, interactive dashboard layout, added filters for easy navigation, and published the final report.
